# Exercism CSharp
Challenges to enhance logic and programming skills in the C# language.

## About Language
The C# (*C Sharp*) programming language is multi-paradigm, object-oriented and strongly typed. It is developed and maintained by Microsoft.

### Basics
In C#, variables have types defined at compile time. Assigning values to variables can be done explicitly, by specifying the type, or implicitly using the 'var' keyword. Once defined, the type of a variable cannot be changed. The language is object-oriented, requiring all functions to be defined in a class. Methods within a class are invoked using the dot syntax, and static methods can be called in the class itself. Fundamental concepts include mutation (changing variable values) and scope (limits on access to values).

* [Lucian's Luscious Lasagna](https://exercism.org/tracks/csharp/exercises/lucians-luscious-lasagna)

### Boleans
Booleans are represented by the bool type, with values of true or false.
There are four supported boolean operators: ! (NOT), && (AND), || (OR) and ^ (XOR).

### Strings
A string is an immutable instance, and manipulation occurs through methods or properties, resulting in a new string. Strings are delimited by double quotes. Concatenation can be done with the + operator, but for more complex formatting, the $ symbol is used for string interpolation.
